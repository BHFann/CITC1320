        <h2>An introduction to Flesh and Blood</h2>
        <p>Flesh and Blood is a new trading card game, or TCG for short, that started at the end of 2019 by a company called Legend Story Studios based out of New Zealand. In the world of TCGs, there isn't a lot of room 
            for new games to make an impact and become popular, as Magic: the Gathering (MtG) has dominated public favour for close to 30 years now. I myself have played MtG for the majority of 
            my adult life. However, Flesh and Blood has made an incredible impact in the few years that it has been available internationally, even surviving the initial COVID-19 shutdowns that 
            took the world by surprise.</p>
