                            On Halloween of 2020, our friend Johnny (middle on the couch) got to visit us from Wichita! He is originally from Chattanooga, but he joined the Air Force
                            in 2018, and this was the first time that we were all able to get together since he moved out there! It was a complete blast, and I wouldn't trade this 
                            memory for the world!

                            Back in 2012, me and my brothers we lucky enough to be introduced to our friend Isaac. He lives in Phoenix, Arizona, and we were fortunate enough 
                            for him to be able to visit us twice since we have known him! Even though he can only talk to us from across the country the majority of the time, 
                            we still consider him one of the best people that we have ever met, and I am very lucky to have him in my life!

                            to call my friends. Among them was my girlfriend, Kelsey! We have been friends for the 4 years since 2018, and only last year in 2021 did
